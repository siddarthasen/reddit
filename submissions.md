Submission Notes
These notes will be read by WDB team members!

Given more time, what would you have done differently?
1. Added some common functions into a service insteady of copy pasting it for multiple files. A service would allow me to use the same functions pretty much anywhere in this project. 

2. Unsubscribe from the Observables. Doing this will increase 
performance and prevent memory leaks if this web app were to scale.

3. Clean up my routing. I'm creating the header twice while navigating through the pages. If I had more time, I could clean this up. 

How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?
your answer here. 
1. I added a back button along with clicking the berkeley picture to go back to home. This is for easier navigation. 

Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
1. No.
