      "content": "I have endured blistering winds (EE16A) and scorching deserts (61B with Hilfinger). I climbed the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower (CS70 with Sahai), and I made it through it all. But somehow, in a shocking turn of events, CS61C with Garcia (such a nice guy) is where I draw the line. Between the disastrous quest, inefficient online help queue, condescending members of course staff, and sheer workload, I won't put myself through it anymore. Goodbye, 61C.",

There’s no answer to hw on website either. Then how can I know the correct answer if I happen to miss a few question before turning it in? I never heard that redoing hw will eventually give us a zero. And now the stuff is like “ah we are sorry to hear that, losing two points in hw isn’t a big deal, we can’t give points back to you, Gradescope don’t allow us to do that” the thing is why I have to pay the consequences when it’s not my fault? Why not have some hw drops? Why do they not warn us not to do that before hand? Disappointing and Condescending staff indeed",

      "content": "I was talking to a friend who is a year older, abt how this midterm(CS 61a) was perhaps a little easier than past years(definitely still tricky tho, just maybe not the insane difficulty of spring 2020, were they averaged 21/40 or something) and she kinda mentioned that they might make the others harder to compensate, to restrict the number of kids who can declare CS. Idk to what extent this will happen, as I’m just a clueless freshman, but it did get me thinking: Why does Berkeley want to restrict the number of kids who can major in CS? So many who miss the cutoff end up doing something like data sci, were they take a bunch of the same classes and generally end up as SWEs anyway. So the issue wouldn’t seem to be abt not being able to fit everyone into the classes, right? So why have a bunch of kids who are passionate abt CS take data science instead of CS? Nothing against the data science major, it seems like a pretty solid thing to do, if that’s what you want to do. But if you prefer pure CS and will work in CS, it just seems kinda dumb imo to force you out of the CS major cuz u got Bs in a couple hard classes. Is my outline of the situation incorrect? Ik of course, that some people might genuinely fall for data sci and then do that, but it still remains that there would seem to be a lot of ppl who major data sci but may as well be majoring CS.",
